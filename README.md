# Password Generator
An Introduction to JavaScript

This application was created to generate a random password based on user-selected criteria.  It makes use of a knowledge of the browser and features dynamic HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.  The challenges with this application exist when creating the JavaScript onclick functionality that allows different user selections.  Likewise, the application had to include an interactive and responsive page to adapt to multiple screen sizes.

### Technologies Utilized:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap 4
* JavaScript

### Features Included:

The user can designate which characters they want to include in their password, which offers some customization:

- Special Characters
- Numeric Characters
- Lowercase Characters
- Uppercase Characters

Additional features include the option to copy the password to the user's "clipboard" to paste in another area/window.

# Password Generator
---

### Description

An Introduction to JavaScript

This application was created to generate a random password based on user-selected criteria.  It makes use of a knowledge of the browser and features dynamic HTML, CSS and JavaScript code.  The challenges with this application exist when creating the JavaScript onclick functionality that allows different user selections.  Likewise, the application had to include an interactive and responsive page to adapt to multiple screen sizes.

### Installation

### Technologies Utilized:
* HTML5
* CSS3
* Bootstrap 4
* JavaScript

### Features Included:

The user can designate which characters they want to include in their password, which offers some customization:

- Uppercase Characters
- Lowercase Characters
- Numeric Characters
- Special Characters

Additional features include the option to copy the password to the user's "clipboard" to paste in another area/window.

### Notes
I started building this application for an end-user in an effort to provide a solution to a daily need. To that end, we hope to achieve some future dated development ideas that will enhance the user engagement with the application.
